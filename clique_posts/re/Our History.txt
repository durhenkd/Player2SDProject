The first Resident Evil was created by Shinji Mikami and Tokuro Fujiwara and released for the PlayStation in 1996.[1][2] It is credited for defining the survival horror genre and returning zombies to popular culture. With Resident Evil 4 (2005), the franchise shifted to more dynamic shooting action; it influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the "over-the-shoulder" third-person view.[3] Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (2017) moved the series to a first-person perspective. Capcom has also released three Resident Evil remakes: Resident Evil (2002), Resident Evil 2 (2019) and Resident Evil 3 (2020), with a Resident Evil 4 remake scheduled for 2023.
